# musicVideos
An innovative web application that allows users to explore music videos of related artists based on their favorite musicians. Leveraging the power of both the Spotify API and the YouTube API, this project provides an exciting way to discover new music related to your favorite artists.

You will require a Spotify API key, Youtube API, and Weather API key for this.

1. In the Components folder, create a file called "config.js" with the following lines, then input your keys from those APIs
export const youtubeKey = ''; export const weatherKey = '';

2. In the Components folder, create a file called "config.json", similarly, get spotify's API.
{
    "spotify.clientId": "",
    "spotify.clientSecret": ""

  }

3. In the components folder, create a file called "configSpotifyToken.js"
4. Then run ConfigSpotify.js using Terminal
-> cd into Components folder, run "node ConfigSpotify.js", then cd out
5. npm start
